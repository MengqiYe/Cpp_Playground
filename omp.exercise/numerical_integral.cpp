/* Exercise
 * Compute $\pi$ by numerical integration .
 * We use the fact that $\pi$ is the area of the unit circle,
 * and we approximate this by computing the area of a quarter circle using Riemann sums .
 *
 * Let $f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}$ be the function that describes the quarter circle for $x=0â€¦ 1$;
 * Then we compute \[ \pi/4\approx\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \Delta x f(x_i) \qquad \hbox{where $x_i=i\Delta x$ and $\Delta x=1/N$} \]
 * Write a program for this, and parallelize it using OpenMP parallel for directives.
 *
 * 1. Put a parallel directive around your loop. Does it still compute the right result?
 * Does the time go down with the number of threads? (The answers should be no and no.)
 * 2. Change the parallel to parallel for (or \n{parallel do}). Now is the result correct?
 * Does execution speed up? (The answers should now be no and yes.)
 * 3. Put a critical directive in front of the update. (Yes and very much no.)
 * 4. Remove the critical and add a clause reduction (+:quarterpi) to the for directive.
 * Now it should be correct and efficient.
